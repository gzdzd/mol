        "description": "Formoterol is an inhaled beta2-agonist used in the management of COPD and asthma that was first approved for use in the United States in 2001. It acts on bronchial smooth muscle to dilate and relax airways, and is administered as a racemic mixture of its active (R;R)- and inactive (S;S)-enantiomers. A major clinical advantage of formoterol over other inhaled beta-agonists is its rapid onset of action (2-3 minutes), which is at least as fast as [salbutamol], combined with a long duration of action (12 hours) - for this reason, treatment guidelines for asthma recommend its use as both a reliever and maintenance medication. It is available as a single-entity product and in several formulations in combination with both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Formoterol is a long-acting beta-adrenergic receptor agonist with bronchodilator activity. Formoterol selectively binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, thereby activating intracellular adenyl cyclase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, relieve bronchospasms, improve mucociliary clearance and reduce mediator substance release from inflammatory cells, especially from mast cells.

Let's break down its main structural features:\n\n1. **Backbone Composition**: \n   - The molecule primarily consists of a long hydrocarbon chain with alternating single and double bonds. This is depicted through the successive `C(=C/CC/` patterns. The SMILES notation suggests that the structure features conjugated alkene groups with potential for linear or slightly bent arrangements depending on the specific 3D configuration.\n\n2. **Polyisoprene Structure**:\n   - The repeated pattern `(=C/CC/C(=C/` indicates it is similar to a polyisoprene structure, a polymer of isoprene units. Isoprene is a key building block for natural rubber, and this linear repeat may imply a synthetic or modified version.\n\n3. **Functional Group**:\n   - Towards the end of the chain, the string `COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)O` indicates the presence of a phosphate diester group. This group includes two phosphate moieties connected via an ester linkage, key to many biological molecules and synthetic polymers. The presence of this group suggests a possible involvement in biochemical applications.\n\n4. **Overall Length and Size**:\n   - The extensive repetition of the chain indicates that the molecule is likely a high-molecular-weight compound, emphasizing its polymeric character.\n\n5. **Cis/Trans Configuration**:\n   - The SMILES notation uses closures `/` and `\\` which tell about stereochemistry in implicit form. As per given, it implies that atoms across double bonds have specific steric arrangements.\n\nIn summary, the molecule is a very large polyene that serves as a backbone with many repeating unsaturated segments, suggesting a polymer-like nature, capped with a critical biologically active phosphate ester group. The specific stereochemistry and exceedingly long chain provide potential industrial or biochemical applications similar to those seen in synthetic rubbers or biopolymers.",
