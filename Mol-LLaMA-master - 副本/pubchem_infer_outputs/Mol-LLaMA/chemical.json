It acts on bronchial smooth muscle to dilate and relax airways, and is administered as a racemic mixture of its active (R;R)- and inactive (S;S)-enantiomers. A major clinical advantage of formoterol over other inhaled beta-agonists is its rapid onset of action (2-3 minutes), which is at least as fast as [salbutamol], combined with a long duration of action (12 hours) - for this reason, treatment guidelines for asthma recommend its use as both a reliever and maintenance medication. It is available as a single-entity product and in several formulations in combination with both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Formoterol is a long-acting beta-adrenergic receptor agonist with bronchodilator activity. Formoterol selectively binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, thereby activating intracellular adenyl cyclase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).
